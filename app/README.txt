***VIEWING THE CALENDAR***

--MONTHLY VIEW--
In monthly view you can view each month of the year and if there is events for that
month they will show up as their priority color on the calendar. If clicked an event
will occur where you can see all events that are available for that day, and if you 
chooseyou may go to that day in the daily view.

--WEEKLY VIEW--
In weekly view, the layout is similar to monthly, where you can choose from any day of 
the week,and increment the weeks with the previous and next buttons. In weekly view a 
list view will be shown below the weekly calendar, where you can click to go to the 
event details for that event.

--DAILY VIEW--
In daily view you may view events for that day. Current version of the app does not
allow for choosing between days, only the current day, or the day chosen from the 
monthly calendar.


***VIEW EVENTS ON CALENDAR***

Once the day is clicked on, the event it holds is shown on a pop up screen, 
and then it has the ability to become editable if you wish to update or delete
the event.

The far right button at the top of the screen takes you to the add event page.
From there you can type the name of the event you would like to add and it will 
be on, the times it starts and ends, as well as a description.The user will then 
be allowed to choose a color based on the urgency of the event.The colors are as 
follows: green, orange, blue, yellow, and turquoise. Once all fields are entered,
